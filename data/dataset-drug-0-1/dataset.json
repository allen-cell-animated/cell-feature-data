  "description": "The goal of our drug perturbation pilot study is to identify signature profiles of cellular organization for a range of well-characterized agonists and antagonists commonly used to perturb specific cellular processes or pathways. â€‹The analysis not only shows the effects of these drugs on structures they are known to perturb but also on other structures providing a rich signature of pathway alterations.",
